                                        <p>
                                            Biological differences in genetic makeup can make one person more susceptible to addiction than another. Contrary to popular belief, there is not one single “addiction gene”. In fact, many genes influence addiction. Different levels of dopamine receptors in people also can influence susceptibility to addiction. If a person has a quite high number or receptors, then the drug will feel much better to them than another person with perhaps a lower number of dopamine receptors, and so the first person is more susceptible to addiction.

                                        <h3> Psychological </h3>
                                        <p>
                                           The cause of addiction can also be psychologically based. Some people see doing a drug as a way to cope with uncomfortable feelings or stress. Substance abuse can also begin by trying to alleviate psychological issues as a form of self-medication. These psychological issues include but are not limited to schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, bipolar, or personality disorders such as antisocial personality disorder.

                                        <p>
                                            The environment one is in can affect one’s susceptibility to drug addiction. Some of these social factors include stress, early physical or sexual abuse, witnessing violence, peers who use drugs, and drug availability.

                                        <p>
                                           Alcohol addiction causes permanent changes to the brain. It does so by altering your brain chemistry. Long-term chemical changes in the brain are thought to be responsible for alcohol dependence. The method in which alcohol addiction alters your brain function is through neurotransmitters. A neurotransmitter is a chemical in the brain that serves as a messenger of signals between neurons and other cells in the body. They normally help regulate body’s function and behavior. While a person is intoxicated, it alters the balance of neurotransmitter chemicals. With long-term intoxication, the brain tries to alter its chemistry so that the brain will function closer to normal while intoxicated. The physical long term effects of alcohol abuse can include anemia (loss of oxygen-carrying red blood cells), cirrhosis (liver becomes unable to function), dementia, depression, seizures, gout, and pancreatitis.

                                        <p>
                                            Like alcohol addiction, heroin addiction permanently changes the physiology of the brain, and these changes are not easily reversed. Heroin addictions creates tolerance, meaning you need more and more of the drug in order to get to the same level of high. Heroin also causes a strong physical dependence. Having a physical dependence on a drug causes withdrawal symptoms to begin after abrupt discontinuation or reduction of dosage. Specifically, heroin binds to the receptors in the brain called mu-opiod receptors (MORs). Normally our bodies natural neurotransmitters bind to these MORs, but when heroin is taken, this external drug binds to the MORs releasing dopamine in the brain. A release of dopamine in the brain increases feelings of pleasure, and blocks feelings of pain, among other things. Heroin can have many detrimental effects on the body as well. Long term use can lead to reduced sexual capacity, depression, loss of appetite, weakening of the immune system, bad teeth, insomnia, loss of memory, arthritis, and respiratory illnesses. By injecting heroin, a whole new slew of results can occur, such as collapsed veins leading to infections of the blood vessels and also sharing needles can lead to AIDS and other contagious infections such as Hepatitis.

                                        <h3 >Results of Cocaine Addiction</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            As a result of Cocaine abuse, addicts experience both neurological and physical negative effects. The addict’s brain adapts to the repeated use of the drug and reward pathway becomes less sensitive to the drug. This phenomena is known as tolerance. It also causes the addicts brain to become less sensitive to the natural reinforcers of the reward pathway themselves. With cocaine addiction, the most affected part of the brain is a region of midbrain called the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Cocaine blocks removal of dopamine from synapses in the brain. This results in an accumulation of dopamine in the brain and amplified signal to receiving neurons known as dopamine receptors. Another phenomena called sensitization can also occur. This means that the addict becomes more sensitive to cocaine’s effect as time increases. Long term use can lead to irritability, paranoia, panic attacks, restlessness, and psychosis. Also, different methods of ingesting the drug can cause their own results. For example, snorting the drug can lead to loss of smell, hoarseness, nosebleeds, problems swallowing, and chronically inflamed and runny nose. There are different specific effects for ingested cocaine, and injected cocaine. Although no matter which manner you ingest the drug, loss of appetite, significant weight loss and malnourishment occur in many chronic users.

                                            The decision to get sober can be made much more difficult for any addict because of the inevitable withdrawal symptoms that come along with stopping use of a drug. Alcohol withdrawal in particular causes symptoms like nausea, trembling, sweating, extreme alcohol cravings, and increased heart rate. These withdrawal symptoms can last around five to seven days after the addict’s last drink. The exact withdrawal symptoms a person will experience can be unique to the individual. Some have very mild symptoms, and others can have more serious symptoms such as delirium and marked tremors.

                                        <p>
                                            Withdrawal symptoms for heroin addicts have a much faster onset than most other drugs. Heroin withdrawal symptoms can start as early as a few hours after the last dose of the drug is ingested. Symptoms are the worst between 24-48 hours after the last dose. Symptoms can last up to a week. The specific symptoms addicts experience can include restlessness, muscle and bone pain, insomnia, diarrhea, vomiting, cold flashes, and leg movements.

                                        <p>
                                            Once an addict stops taking cocaine, withdrawal symptoms begin. These symptoms include strong cravings, fatigue, anxiety, irritability, exhaustion, inability to feel pleasure from a normal source, depression, paranoia, chills, body aches, and tremors. The beginning of withdrawl is marked by a crash, which is very similar to the exact opposite feeling the user feels when they ingest the drug. Withdrawal symptoms can last 1-2 weeks after the last dose of the drug is taken.

                                        <h3>Alcohol Rehab Strategies/Methods</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            For any addictive behavior, the most effective means of treatment include a combination of both pharmacological and behavioral therapy. Medications can be prescribed such as Acamprosate, Natrexone, Disulfiram, and Baclofen. These drugs are prescribed to either ease alcohol cravings, cause unpleasant symptoms if alcohol is drunk, or to reduce alcohol-related anxiety. Behavioral therapy is also recommended. Such therapies can include group therapy like Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12-step programs, which have proven quite successful. In choosing a rehabilitation plan, it is also important to decide if either a long term or short term rehabilitation center is right for the addict.

                                        <h3>Heroin Rehab Strategies/Methods</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            Medication (pharmacological) and behavioral treatments have both been proven effective, yet in many cases a combination of the two can lead to the most success. There are three options for types of medications to give patients for pharmacological treatments: agonists, partial agonists and antagonists. Agonists (for example Methadone) activate the same opioid receptors in the brain that heroin does. Partial agonists (for example Buprenorphine) activate the opioid receptors, but with a smaller response. Antagonists (Naltrexone) blocks receptor, interfering with the rewarding effects of activating opioid receptors. In terms of behavioral therapy, Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has proven very useful in treatment programs, altering the addicts thinking about their addictive behavior and addressing stressors in life that can lead to drug abuse. Another method of behavioral therapy that has been proven quite successful is called Contingency Management, in which patients receive rewards for good behaviors. These rewards encourage healthy living.

                                        <h3>Cocaine Rehab Strategies/Methods</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            Like with other addictive substances, a combination of pharmacological and behavioral rehabilitation strategies has been proven most successful in helping addicts overcome their addictions. Unfortunately for cocaine addicts, no FDA approved medications are currently on the market to treat cocaine addiction. Much research is currently being done to find a drug to assist cocaine addiction, but no solutions have been found yet although some medicines used for other diseases such as alcoholism have showed some promise in clinical trials. Behavioral therapy is currently the only form of therapy for stimulant addictions. Community based rehabilitation options have been proven quite effective, for example Cocaine/Narcotics Anonymous or community residential programs. Cognitive behavioral therapy is also quite effective. In CBT, therapists teach addicts to recognize feelings/situations in which they might relapse, avoid these situations when they can, and cope better with the problems associated with drug abuse. The final behavioral therapy which has been proven effective is contingency management, which is a reward system for patients who do not relapse.

                                        <li>
                                            Research shows that more people leave short term rehab facilities with completion of the program than they do at long term rehab facilities
